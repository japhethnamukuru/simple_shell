## Shell Concepts

**Fundamentals concepts in shell development**

### Child and Parent Processes

**PID & PPID**

---

#### PID

 A `process` is an instance of an executing program, that has a **unique process ID**. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid`. (`man 2 getpid`).

- [x] [0-get_pid.c](pid.c) - gets a child process ID using the `getpid` system call. Everytime the progrma is executed a new instance is created with a different  ID.

---

#### PPID

Each process has a `parent`: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the `getppid` system call (`man 2 getppid`), from within the child process.

- [x] [1-get_ppid.c](ppid.c) - gets the parent process id from within the child process using the `getppid` system call.
