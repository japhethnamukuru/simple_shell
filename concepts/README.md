### Child and Parent Processes

**PID & PPID**

---
 A `process` is an instance of an executing program, that has a **unique process ID**. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid`. (`man 2 getpid`).

- [x] [Example.c](pid.c) - gets a child process ID using the `getpid` system call.
