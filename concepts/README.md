## Shell Concepts

**Fundamentals concepts in shell development**

### Child and Parent Processes

**PID & PPID**

---

#### PID

 A `process` is an instance of an executing program, that has a **unique process ID**. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid`. (`man 2 getpid`).

- [x] [0-get_pid.c](pid.c) - gets a child process ID using the `getpid` system call. Everytime the progrma is executed a new instance is created with a different  ID.

---

#### PPID

Each process has a `parent`: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the `getppid` system call (`man 2 getppid`), from within the child process.

- [x] [1-get_ppid.c](ppid.c) - gets the parent process id from within the child process using the `getppid` system call.


---

### commandline arguments

command line arguments are passed through the the `main` function:

``` 
int main(int ac, char **av);
```
where:
	- `av` is a `NULL` terminated array of strings.
	- `ac` is the number of elements in `av`.

- [x] [2-args.c](2-args.c) - prints the number of arguments passed to the program without using `ac`.

### Reading line from the stdin file stream

`getline` is the function used to get a single line of `stdin` in C as so:

- [x] [3-get_line.c](3-get_line.c) - fetches a single line from `stdin` using the `getline()` function. `getline()` allocates memory to the buffer i.e `line` in the above file thus `free(line)` is required after the operatiotn.

---
#### Working functionality of getline()

`getline()` recieves 3 arguments:
	- A pointer to a buffer i which to store the line string i.e `line` in the above code.
	- A pointer to the size of the buffer.
	- A pointer to the input stream as below:
```
getline(&line, &len, stdin);
```
`getline()` does the following:
	- Allocates memory fpr the string buffer on the heap.
	- Updates the len variable to track memory allocation.
	- Reads a line into the heap allocated string buffer.
	- Returns the length of the string that has been allocated.
__The newline character('\n'), not the null terminator is counted in the length__

The memory allocated may be more than required for the input chars. If less memory is allocated initially, `getline()` can `realloc()` a longer buffer, while updating the `line` variable to point to the new buffer and updating `len`.

- [x] [4-getline.c](4-getline.c) - loops through a file, collecting all lines into a single string. This can be used to read a file passed in  as command line args.
